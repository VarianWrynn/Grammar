- 通篇文章有一个高频的词汇是 **Jane Eyre**贯穿全文，我因为不知道，虽然大致推断出这是一个作家或者小说，但是总觉得格里一层什么。

- draw the line ： 划清界限;一线描画;划定界限;划清界线 reasonably object (to) or set a limit (on)

  > Where do you draw the line between genius and madness? 天才和疯狂之间如何划界呢？

Just can hear a rough taking between the professor and student. Student write a novel by referring Jane Eyre, but he didn't have any further discussion about Jane Eyre, so the professor suggests him to re-write the page?



- P： I'm gong to suggest you rewirte this page, Rong?

- S：That's bad, huh! 

  > 这里听成了 no bad, huh! 感觉学生听起来有点相当自信的意思

- P： Actually, not bad at all. your paper is very well written, but it has a major problem. One that we need to talk about. The novel you wrote about. The why the socres are C? Your novel is based on another novel, right?

- S: Yeah, it based on Jane Eyre. 

- P: Right, so, why didn't you discuss Jane Eyre in your paper?

- S: Well....I never read Jane Eyre, but I aslo thank that \***  why our guess C can stand on its own... ***

  > 这里有个固定搭配： stand on its own 是我从未听过的，因此反复听力10来次未能听懂。最后在百度翻译等帮助下逐渐推断出来。

  > 这个成语应该是  **[stand on your own (two) feet](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stand-on-your-own-two-feet)**  的简写形式

  > - After that, the Jin forces dared not cross the Yangyze River and the Southern Song could **stand on its own feet**.  此后，金军不敢轻易渡江，南宋朝庭得以立足江南。

- P: I don't think anyone can dispute that. Jane Ree is a wonderful author, and if we're just reading a book for fun.

- P: But if you wouldn't wirte an acdemic paper on this book, well, I don't think you can do that without acknowledging Jane Eyre.

- S: Ah, I not sure, I mean, because \***  it isn't every book that's ever been written and influenced  \*** by other book , so...like.. it difficult to know where to draw the line. 

  > - influence可以做动词....
  > - 中间打※的那段说的飞快，带有情绪，很难听的动

- P: But we're not talking about subtle influences in this case.

  > subtle: 我听的出来很熟悉，但是不知道什么意思。。。。一开始以为是sudden,或者suddle,或者saddle....

- P: You should hear that's very concreat case of one writer basing her book directly on another book, and the very famous one of that.

- S: But [Jane Rhye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Rhys) didn't just re-write  Jane Eyre, did she?

  > 这里牵涉到文学只是, Jane Rhye这个人写了一本叫《海藻无边》（*Wide Sargasso Sea*）的书，描述了简爱的前传

- P: If you read Jane Eyre, you'd know that what we still was , in a sense, she re-invented it by writting it from the point of view of the secondary character in Jane Eyre
