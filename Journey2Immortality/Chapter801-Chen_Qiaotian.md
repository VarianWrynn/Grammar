After spending the night in the forest, Han Li withdrew the Sovereign Devil Corpse and made his way to the Myriad Link Mountains.

> 在树林中过了一晚后，第二日韩立就将天煞魔尸收起，直奔万灵山而去。



Before he sought out Violet Spirit and the others the day before, he hadn’t discovered traces of the Heavenpeak Sect disciples. As a result, he continued to hold onto the medallion that the Heavenpeak Elder had given him but hadn’t had a chance to use it. It was also out of the question to seek out Marquis Nanlong. It seemed the Heavenpeak Sect had either found another area of residence or that they hadn’t even arrived yet.

> 日在找到紫灵等人之前，他并未在城中发现天极门弟子的踪影。故而虽然手中持有那枚天极门长老所赠的令牌，也一时无法用上，更谈不上找到南陇侯了。看样子不是天极门修士另有住处，就是此宗门的人尚还未来此处。



Han Li wasn’t worried about this and instead prepared a temporary place to stay nearby the mountains and refine a few Core Formations stage puppets in the downtime. With the Yin Yang Rings in his possession, he reckoned Marquis Nanlong would take the initiative to seek him out. 

> 韩立对此倒也不急，他准备到万灵山附近，找一处地方暂时安置下来，顺便炼制一些结丹期的傀儡。手中有那两仪环的他，就是自己不找去，估计南陇侯也会主动找上门来的。



As of current, Han Li faintly realized that the Greatnorth Essence Light wasn’t something that existed outside of the entrance to the valley. Most of it appeared at the entrance of the valley. Were this not the case, the Ghost Spirit Sect wouldn’t have the ability to take several hundreds of cultivators simultaneously into the valley, regardless of how skilled they may be.

> 到现在韩立也隐隐明白，对方口中的北极元光肯定不是在外谷的入口处，多半出现在进入内谷的通道中。否则鬼灵门就是有天大本事，也无法让数百名修士同时避过北极远光而入谷中的。



As these thoughts appeared in Han Li’s mind, he flew in a streak of azure light and calmly went forward. With his speed, he was able to fly tens of kilometers away after only a short moment. Less than half a day later, he arrived near the Myriad Link Mountains.

> 韩立一边思量着，一边化为一道青虹，不慌不忙的前进着。以韩立的遁速，片刻间就将远处的叶桦城抛的不见了踪影，遁出了数十里之外去。以现在遁速，飞遁到万灵山附近，也只是小半日的工夫而已。



He had heard that there were several market cities that had recently opened nearby the Myriad Link Mountains and decided to pay a visit to them along the way and collect a few materials for refining puppets. Additionally, Han Li had acquired quite a few rare materials after the war with the Moulan in exchange for their ancient heritage lantern that he had seized during the battle.

> 听说万灵山附近的几处坊市，早已闻风先动的开放了起来。韩立正好先去这些坊市，收购一些炼制傀儡的材料。韩立曾经在边界之战的赌斗中和用那盏慕兰人的传承古灯，得到了几乎一个中等宗门积全部蓄的珍稀材料。



Those materials were nearly priceless and would allow Han Li to craft an amazing quantity of high-grade puppets. As such, he would only be purchasing a few basic puppet materials while inside the city.

> 这些价值近千万灵石的材料，足以让韩立炼制出让人望而生畏的大量高阶傀儡。所以他去坊市收购的，反倒是一些炼制傀儡时常见的普通材料。



As for the materials needed to refine the ancient Nascent Soul stage puppets, the Thousand Bamboo School in the Far West had managed to gather three of the materials, but they were still missing a material known as the Blood Phoenix Wood.

> 至于他一心想炼制的上古元婴级傀儡，虽然在极西之地的千竹教那里，又找到两三种欠缺材料，但还未凑齐全部。还有一种叫做“血凤木”材料，一直都未收集到。



The material was a rarely seen peak grade tool refining material. Although it wasn’t as nearly difficult to acquire as the Auric Essence, it was also impossible to find in markets. One would only be able to come across it as a matter of luck. Fortunately, Han Li had already ordered the Drifting Cloud Sect to be on the lookout for the appearance of such a material. If they acquired any information, they were to directly notify him. It would only be a matter of time before he acquired it, but not before he entered Devilfall Valley.

> 此种材料，是一种少见的顶阶炼器材料。虽然不像庚精这般难以得手，那也是有价无市的东西。什么时候可以收集到，只能碰运气了。好在韩立早已吩咐落云宗弟子，帮其留意着，一有此种材料的消息，一定要及时拿下或干脆通知他，凑齐此物只是迟早的事情。不过在进入坠魔谷前，根本是无法来及了。



Suddenly, Han Li’s expression stirred and he came to a sudden stop. Not far away from him, there was a surge of spiritual Qi fluctuations and flickers of light, where a few cultivators were having a fierce battle. Han Li frowned but didn’t pay it much heed. As of current, the area was swarming with all sorts of characters and it wouldn’t be rare for enemies to occasionally encounter one another.

> 忽然韩立神色一动，遁光顿了一顿，遁速一下大缓起来。因为在前边不远处灵气激荡，光华闪动，竟有修士正在激烈的斗法着。韩立眉头皱了一皱，但并不在意。现在此地龙蛇混杂，又没有什么人来主持大局，有仇家碰到一起，打斗一场也是很正常之事。



With Han Li’s cultivation, he approached them from a kilometer away. Meanwhile, the cultivators were still fighting, oblivious to his presence. There were four men and one woman, battling against each other in two parties.

> 以韩立修为，眨眼间接近了他们数百丈之内，这些修士仍然茫然不知的自顾自的拼斗着。四男一女，分成敌对双方。



Han Li swept his gaze past them only to discover that they were all Core Formation cultivators at the mid and early stages. However, hostilities between the sides were great. Not only were magic treasures soaring through the skies, but various talismans also ruptured around them. 

> 韩立目光一扫之下，看出了他们都是结丹期修为，并且大多是结丹初中期的样子。不过双方似乎结怨不小，不但法宝漫天飞舞，手中各种符箓更对射爆裂个不停。



However, the party of three with the woman were being completely suppressed by the other two cultivators. However, it wasn’t due to a more profound cultivation; it was because of the several hundred huge moths that they surrounded the opposing three cultivators with.

> 但是其中两男一女的一方，却反而被对方两名修士，给彻底压在了下风。不过这倒不是对面的修士，法力比他们高深的缘故，而是一高一矮的两名修士，竟然驱使着数百只巨大飞蛾，将二男一女团团围在了中间。



These frightening moths were the size of a palm and their wings emitted a poisonous rainbow powder. As a result, the three cultivators had to use a majority of their energy toward keeping themselves free from it. And under the additional assault of the two cultivators’ magic treasures, the three found it difficult to endure.

> 这些手掌大小的恐怖巨蛾，双翅挥动之间，必定有五彩斑斓的毒粉喷出，迎头洒出。对面三人倒有大半精力都用来施法将自己护的风雨不透了。再加上这两名男修的法宝夹攻，那三名男女穷于应付之下，自然不敌了。



While the three cultivators found themselves at a disadvantage, the battle was far from over. Apart from the poisonous moths and the silver brush and golden scroll magic treasures that the scholarly man wielded, Han Li found the battle to be little of note given their cultivation.

> 不过韩立目光看来，三名男女虽然处在了下风，但要真正分出胜负来，也不是一时半刻可以做到的。并且以这些人的修为，除了那些毒蛾和一名锦袍儒生祭出的银色巨笔和金色书卷法宝，让韩立感兴趣些的多看了两眼外，其他修士的斗法自然不入韩立的法眼了。



Although he didn’t know what sects these cultivators belonged to, Han Li had little interest in being involved with other people’s affairs. Just as he thought to fly away, he suddenly spotted an emblem of Yellow Maple Valley from the robes of the scholarly man.

> 虽然不知道这些修士是何门派，但韩立也没有兴趣多管闲事。正想不管不问的一闪而过时，目光一转之下，忽然发现那儒生的袖口上绣着一个黄色枫叶标记。



“Yellow Maple Valley?” Han Li glanced at the scholar’s face with surprise. As Han Li paused, the battle quickly shifted in favor of the two cultivators controlling the moths.

> “黄枫谷？”韩立怔了一怔，有些意外。接着目光在儒生面容上扫了两眼，神色为之一动。



When Han Li decided to approach, the two cultivators hastily spread out their spiritual sense in alarm and their expressions vastly changed.

> 但就这片刻耽搁，在斗法中大占上风的两名修士，终于发现了已欺身百丈之内的韩立遁光。



The pair of cultivators hastily withdrew their magic treasures, but they had their poisonous moths continue to tangle with the three other cultivators. They flew distantly to the side and saluted Han Li. “May we know the Senior that has graced us with his presence? We are disciples from the Controlling Spirit Sect.” 

> 两名驱使毒蛾的修士一惊之下，急忙用神识扫去，结果同时脸色大变起来。“不知是哪位前辈驾临此地，晚辈御灵宗弟子参加前辈。”那高矮两名修士急忙收了法宝和，只留下众毒蛾还和那三名男女修士纠缠，自己则飞遁到一旁的远远冲韩立抱拳施礼。



“The Controlling Spirit Sect? You two are Devil cultivators?” When Han Li heard this, he ceased flying and vanished the light he was flying in, revealing his true form.

> “御灵宗！你二人是魔宗修士？”一听此言，韩立干脆飞至了他们的上空，将遁光停下，现出了自己身形。



“You are the Drifting Cloud Sect’s Senior Han!” The taller of the two cultivators immediately recognized him and cried out in alarm.

> “你是落云宗的韩前辈！”其中高个子修士，一看清楚韩立真容，立刻失声的脱口叫道，竟认出了韩立来。



Han Li shot a glance at him and indifferently asked, “You recognize me?” 

> “你认得我？”韩立望了此人一眼，淡淡的说道。



The Controlling Spirit Sect cultivators grew restless, but they maintained a respectful appearance and one of them replied, “When Senior fought in the border battle, I witnessed Senior Han’s vast abilities.”

> “晚辈曾经参加过边界之战，曾见过韩前辈的大展神通。”那名御灵宗修士心中大为不安，但表面上却更加恭敬的回道。



“That is good. Although I don’t want to interfere with the affairs of Juniors, I have some kind of a relationship with Yellow Maple Valley. Put away those spirit insects and abandon the battle for today.” Han Li spoke resolutely with a glint shining in his eye.

> “你们认得我也好。我虽然不想插手你们这些晚辈的事情。但是我和黄枫谷有些旧交，你们将那些灵虫收了，今日的争斗就到此为止。”韩立也没客气，目中精光一闪后，开门见山的直接说道。



When they heard Han Li, they couldn’t help but glance at each other in dismay.

> 一听韩立此言，这二人互望了一眼，不禁面面相觑起来。



“What? Do you two Fellow Daoists feel that this is difficult to do?” Han Li’s expression grew sullen, and his tone turned harsh.

> “怎么。两位道友觉得很为难吗？”韩立脸色一沉，口气有些不善起来。



The taller of the cultivators felt his heart drop upon seeing Han Li’s change in expression and he inwardly cursed. Since Han Li had decided to involve himself, they had no leeway. He hurriedly replied, “Since it is Senior’s orders, we will naturally obey.” 

> “既然是前辈吩咐，晚辈自然遵命。”高个子修士倒也机灵的很，一见韩立此表情，心中顿时“咯噔”一下，暗叫自己糊涂。既然这位插手此事了。他们那还有迟疑的余地，马上出言答应道。



He meaningfully glanced at the other cultivator and the two grasped their hands in an incantation gesture. After hastily casting a spell seal to the swarm of moths, they summoned their spirit beast pouches into the air. In an instant, the moths surrounding the three opposing cultivators scattered and they darted into the storage pouches.

> 接着他冲另一名修士使出眼色，两人手中掐诀，急忙打出一道道法决出去，同时祭出了两只灵兽袋到半空中。顿时和那三名男女纠缠不休的毒蛾，一哄而散的向空中飞去，一窝蜂的钻进了空中的灵兽袋中。



The three cultivators had already seen Han Li, but they were unable to clearly hear the conversation the other two had with him due to being assaulted by the moths. But now that they were unfathomably released from the moths, they knew it had something to do with Han Li. In their delight, they exchanged a glance with one another and hastily flew towards him.

> 那三名男女修士自然也早就看到了韩立，只是刚才被毒蛾的毒粉攻击，并未听清韩立和对手的交谈的言语。但现在莫名其妙的一下脱困而出，自然知道肯定和新闯入此地的韩立有关。这三人心中大喜后，当即互望了一眼后，也急忙向韩立飞来。



At that moment, the two Controlling Spirit Sect cultivators felt unwilling to further stay. One of them carefully said, “Would Senior have any other commands for us? We will follow them as best we can.” 

> 但就在这时，这两名御灵宗魔修不知是害怕韩立，还是不愿和那三名男女修士待在一起，小心的冲韩立说道：“不知前辈还有事情吩咐晚辈吗？晚辈一定尽心的。”



Han Li guessed their intentions and waved his hand. “There is nothing else. You two may leave.” 

> “没什么事了。你二人可以离开了。”韩立似乎猜到了二人的心思，一摆手的淡然道。



“Then we will both take our leave.” When the two heard him, they hastily bowed and immediately set off in streaks of green light.

> “那晚辈就先告辞了。”这两人一听此话，如闻大赦之言，冲韩立匆忙的施了一礼后，马上化为两道绿光，向远处破空飞逃。



At that moment, the other three cultivators flew over.

> 而这时，锦袍儒生三人刚刚飞了过来。



Seeing that the Controlling Spirit Sect cultivators had left, the three glanced at each other in astonishment. Their leader, the middle-aged green-robed scholarly man, stepped forward and saluted Han Li. He wore a respectful expression and said, “Many thanks for Senior’s rescue, I cannot thank you enough. May I know Senior’s name?” The scholarly man was surprised to see how young Han Li appeared, but he felt as if his appearance was somewhat familiar.

> 看见御灵宗修士逃离走的情形，这三人自然惊讶的互望了一眼。然后由那为首的中年儒生上前施礼后，一脸恭谨之色的说道：“多谢前辈出手相救，我兄妹三人感激不尽。不知前辈尊姓大名？”这儒生一见韩立如此年轻，心中惊讶之余，却觉得韩立面容有些熟悉，仿佛在哪里见过的样子。



Instead of answering, Han Li expressionlessly asked, “You are cultivators from Yellow Maple Valley?” 

> “你是黄枫谷修士？”韩立并没有回答对方，反而面无表情的问道。



“Junior is Yellow Maple Valley’s Chen Qiaotian. These are my sworn siblings, disciples of the Saber Transformation Dock. Is Senior acquainted with Martial Ancestor Linghu?” When he saw that Han Li had assisted them despite not belonging to the Six Sects of Yue, he realized that this Nascent Soul Senior should have a relationship with their Martial Ancestor Linghu.

> “晚辈黄枫谷陈巧天。这是在下的结义兄妹，他们是化刀坞弟子。前辈否和令狐祖师认识？”这儒生小心翼翼的说道。他见韩立并非认识的六派高人，但却出手相助，自然觉得这位元婴期前辈恐怕和令狐老祖有交情才会相助的。



“Chen Qiaotian? You’re a member of the Chen Clan?” A strange expression appeared on Han Li’s face. 

> “陈巧天！你是陈氏家族的人？”韩立脸上浮现一丝异样神色。



The scholarly man revealed a stunned expression, “Senior knows of my clan?”

> “前辈也知道晚辈家族？”这儒生大感惊讶，愕然了起来。



Han Li grew silent and began to closely examine the scholarly man, much to the unease of the three Core Formation cultivators.

> 韩立沉默了下来，只是重新打量起儒生几眼。这让对面的三人有些惴惴不安起来。



Han Li sighed and slowly said, “The Chen Clan is one of the three great clans of Yellow Maple Valley. How could I not know of it. What is your relationship with Chen Qiaoqian?” 

> “陈氏家族是黄枫谷三大修仙家族之一，我怎会不知道？你和陈巧倩是什么关系？”韩立轻吐了一口气后，缓缓问道。



“Senior recognizes my younger sister?” The scholarly man asked in alarm.

> “前辈认得家妹？”儒生一呆之下，吃惊的说道。



“Chen Qiaoqian is your little sister?” Although Han Li had guessed this was the case, a trace of surprise appeared in his eyes. As for the scholarly man, he was at a complete loss as to what relationship this expert had with his little sister. 

> “陈巧倩是你妹妹？”韩立虽然猜到了几分，但听对方如此一说，还是露出意外的目光。而儒生更是摸不着头脑，不知眼前的高人和自己的妹妹有何关系。



Han Li’s expression wavered for a moment before he slowly asked, “Is she doing well?”

> “陈巧倩还好吗？”韩立神色不定了好半天，还是缓缓问出了口。



With an odd expression, Chen Qiaotian replied, “My little sister was unable to form a core and died over a hundred years ago from an illness.”

> “家妹并非结丹修士，早在百余年前得了一场怪病，就已去世。”陈巧天面带古怪的回道。



“She’s dead...” Han Li couldn’t help but mutter this as her lovely appearance suddenly appeared in his mind. He suddenly recalled the last time they had seen on their trip to the mountains, where she bared her feelings to him. He stood in place for a time as if at a complete loss.

> “去世了！” 韩立闻言，以低不可闻的声音喃喃了一句，脑中不禁浮现了陈巧倩貌美如花的艳容。并回想起和此女最后和自己游山表露心声的一幕，人不禁怔在了原地，有些痴呆起来。



Seeing that Han Li had remained silent with an odd expression on his face, Chen Qiaotian couldn’t help but ask, “Senior knows my little sister?” 

> “前辈认识小妹？”陈巧天见韩立神情如此怪异，半晌之后，还是忍不住的问道。



Forcefully suppressing the sadness in his heart, he calmly replied, “Of course I know her. When I last saw your little sister, she said she was going to marry. But that was before the Invasion of the Devil Dao. I don’t know whether or not the marriage went through.”

> “当然认识！当年见令妹最后一面时，就听说她就要嫁人了。只是后来魔道入侵，不知她婚期是否如期举行了。”韩立将心中淡淡的哀意勉强一收，平静的说道。
