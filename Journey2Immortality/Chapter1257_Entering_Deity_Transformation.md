After the battle with the Elder Devil at Devilfall Valley, the restrictions outside the valley gradually decreased. After so many years passed, the valley became open to any cultivator who wished.

> 坠魔谷自从经历古魔一战后，外谷禁制渐渐消退。经过如此多年，外谷对一般修士也敞开了。



But after so many cultivators scoured the outer valley for treasure, spiritual medicines, ores, and other rare materials until near depletion. Only the most secret and yet discovered corners of the valley might still have something hidden. Perhaps one may find something if they are lucky enough.

> 但进入外谷寻宝的人数一多，谷中各种珍稀矿材，灵草灵木，很快被扫荡的差不多了。只有在极其隐秘，尚未被人发现的角落里，或许偶尔还能找到一些不错的东西。但这必须看个人的运气造化了。



As such, cultivators that seek treasures in the valley became increasingly sparse and now the valley had hardly any difference to an ordinary spiritual area.

> 如此一来，寻宝的修士自然日益稀少起来，到如今外谷更是和一般的灵山灵地没有多大区别。只是早晚才有几名前来碰运气的低阶修士而已。



On the other hand, Devilfall Valley’s interior depths still possessed its ominous reputation.

> 相对而言，坠魔谷的内谷，却越发的凶名显赫。



The restrictions in the valley depths hadn’t weakened despite the many years that had passed. The spatial tears it possessed were as numerous as ever. In addition, in the most recent couple hundred of years, an odd white mist mysteriously filled the area.

> 内谷的禁制过了如此多年，一点都没有减弱，里面的空间裂缝也密密麻麻的依旧存在着。并且到了最近二三百年，谷中不知为何的突然常年弥漫起一种古怪的乳白色迷雾。



Although the mist didn’t directly harm cultivators, anyone who entered it would immediately feel dizzy and have their spiritual sense greatly restricted. If they wanted to head in any further, they would lose their sense of direction.

> 此迷雾虽然不会主动伤害修士，但是任何人一进入其中，都会立刻头晕目眩，同时神识大受限制，只要再稍微深入其中，就会彻底迷失方向。



This strange appearance caused a commotion in the Heavenly South for a time.

> 这种异像的出现，曾经轰动了天南一时。



Many cultivators determined that a rare treasure descended upon the world in the valley and that this mist was a heavenly omen. But no matter how good a treasure is, it can’t be more important than one’s own life. Many high-grade cultivators hesitated to enter the valley, not daring to charge into it.

> 不少修士都判断，这是谷中异宝出世，所引发的一种天兆奇像。不过宝物虽好，自然没有自己小命重要.大多数高阶修士都一时徘徊，不敢冒失的去闯内谷。



But not long after, several vagrant Nascent Soul cultivators were driven by greed and joined hands to enter the valley depths.

> 但不久后，就有数名元婴散修贪念作祟，再依仗自身有几种可破迷雾的宝物，竟然联手闯进了内谷去。



As a result, they were trapped inside the mists for several years and the treasures they relied on to guide them through the mist’s confusion were completely ineffective. Eventually, after wandering randomly, they managed to desperately escape.

> 结果，这几名修士在那迷雾中一困就是数年之久，手中宝物完全失效，最后不知怎么乱撞一通，才灰头灰脸的侥幸逃脱而出。



Later on, several confident cultivators also entered the valley depths, but they met an even worse end, either by running into a spatial tear or being trapped for even longer.

> 后来陆续又有几名自持神通的修士，进入了内谷，但遭遇的更加凄惨，有的直接在迷雾中葬身空间裂缝中，有的则被困更加的长久。



The longest known case had wandered mindlessly in the mist for over fifty years. If it weren’t for the rich spiritual Qi in the valley, this person wouldn’t have been able to sustain himself until he managed to escape.

> 最长的一位，甚至在迷雾中一待就是五六十年光景。要不是内谷中并不缺乏灵气，可以随时随地的吸纳补充法力。这些人恐怕无一能生离谷中。



The rumors came as a shock to many Nascent Soul cultivators, and none dared to rush into the valley.

> 这些事情一一传开，自然让其他元婴修士骇然，再也没有谁敢轻言闯谷的事情了。



As a result, the depths of Devilfall Valley once again became a forbidden zone in the Heavenly South and would rarely have anyone enter it.

> 这般一来，坠魔谷内谷再次成为了天南修仙界的禁地，罕有人在谷口附近徘徊了。



As time passed by, the cultivators of the Heavenly South became accustomed to the mist. Cultivators who entered the valley believed the mist to be natural and none investigated its source.

> 随着岁月的流逝，时间一久，天南修士对内谷的迷雾渐也渐习以为常。有些新进的修士，甚至以为谷中弥漫的白雾，原本就是坠魔谷天生的，无人再追究其产生的源头。



But who could’ve known that inside a hidden corner of the valley, there was a small-scale cave residence carved out of jade.

> 谁也不知道，内谷一处极其隐秘的山谷中，有一处依山坐落的小型洞府，通体用美玉炼制而成，裸露在山谷中。



To the side of the residence, there was what appeared to be a common medicine garden over three hundred meters wide. It contained countless rare spirit medicines that would’ve driven cultivators on the outside mad with envy. And these spirit medicines aged anywhere from several hundred years old to over a thousand, releasing a captivating medicinal scent.

> 而在洞府旁边，有一座看似普通的药园，只有百余丈之广而已。药园中种植着无数让外界修士为之艳红疯狂的珍稀灵药。而这些灵药的年份，少则数百年，多则上千年的火候，散发着诱人的阵阵药香。



Nearby the small valley, there were layers upon layers of restrictions that could easily prevent any Nascent Soul cultivator who entered it from escaping.

> 而小山谷附近，被人设下了玄妙的重重禁制，就是元婴级修士误入其中，也绝难以轻易脱身。



At the center of the medicinal garden, there was a stone building. It was empty apart from a woven mat.

> 如今在药园正中间，有一间青石屋，屋中空荡荡的，除了一块蒲团外竟然任何东西都没有。



A cultivator was sitting cross-legged on it, as still as a statue.

> 而蒲团上，一名修长的人影动也不动的盘坐在那里，仿佛木雕一般。



An unknown amount of time passed before the person began to move. He stood up and slowly stroke out the building.

> 不知过了多久，这名人影一动，站起了身子，缓缓走出了石屋。



Underneath the sunshine, the person’s face was made clear. The face belonged to Han Li, but it was expressionless and incredibly stiff.

> 一出石门，在淡淡的阳光下，这人面容看的真真切切，这赫然正是“韩立”，但神色木然，丝毫表情没有。



Han Li strode to the corner of the medicine garden and reached down, digging out a small green bottle from the dirt. Afterwards, he walked to another corner of the garden until he arrived in front of a few especially green vines and poured a drop of green liquid on its roots.

> “韩立”一步步的走到了药园的一角中，手一抓，竟从地下泥土中抓出一只绿色小瓶，然后再向药园另一处走去，在一株翠绿异常的藤蔓跟前停了下来，并将瓶中的一滴绿液滴在了藤蔓根部。



The vines absorbed the liquid nearly instantly and Han Li turned around, placing the bottle back where it was originally, and head back to the building to meditate.

> 目睹绿液被藤蔓飞快吸收，他毫不迟疑的一转身，再将小瓶埋在了原来之处，又晃悠悠的走回石屋，似乎打算再次盘坐的样子。



But suddenly, he stopped and he held out his hand. A white formation plate was flying towards him.

> 但就在这时，“韩立”忽然脚步一顿，袖跑一晃，一件白光闪动的法盘自行飞射而出。



He caught it and looked down. Large amounts of azure text floated off of it.

> 被他一把抓到了手中，并低首看去。



After heading it, Han Li took to the skies and flew off to another hidden corner of the valley.

> 只见盘青色文字浮现不已，隐隐有人在传递什么消息。



Eventually, he arrived at his destination, in front of a three-meter-wide small-scale spell formation.

> “韩立”立刻腾空而起，化为一道青虹射出了药园，直奔山谷的某处隐秘的角落而去。



He took a seat and uttered not a word.

> “韩立”静静的站在那里，一言不发起来。



A short moment later, the teleportation formation glowed with trembling light and an azure silhouette walked out from it.

> 片刻后，传送阵自行激发了起来，在灵光闪动中，一道淡青色人影传送而出。



The person took large steps forward from the teleportation formation, revealing himself to be another Han Li.

> 当人影一个大步迈出传送阵时，另一个“韩立”赫然出现在了眼前。



The newly appeared Han Li appeared to have the same one that was waiting. He smiled and said, “I’ve troubled you much these past few years. If it weren’t for you delivering spirit medicines to the teleportation formation every day, I fear I wouldn’t have been able to cultivate to the peak of early-Deity Transformation stage in such a short amount of time.

> “这些年，辛苦你了。要不是你每日按时送灵药过去，我恐怕还无法这般短时间，就将化神初期修炼至顶峰。”后出现的韩立，对身前和自己面容一般无二之人，忽然一笑的说道。



“I am you and you are me. What difference is there?” The first Han Li spoke with an indifferent expression. He was the second Nascent Soul that controlled the human-like puppet.

> “我就是你，你就是我，还分什么彼此？”第一个“韩立”神色不变，淡淡说道。他竟是第二元婴操纵的人形傀儡。



The newly arrived Han Li was the original and had just emerged from secluded cultivation from within the spatial pocket.

> 而后出现之人，才是在芥子空间中刚刚闭关出来的真正韩立。



It was now three hundred years since Han Li left the Drifting Cloud Sect.

> 现在已经是韩立离开落云宗三百年之后的时间了。



At the time, he brought Nangong Wan and his disciples away from the sect to an ancient teleportation formation. They then journeyed to the Scattered Star Seas and occupied a small remote island with decent spirit veins. After they were settled there, Han Li made the journey back to the Heavenly South’s Devilfall Valley and entered the spatial pocket where he began to cultivate the Divine Essensefused Light.

> 当年他带着南宫婉一离开落云宗后，却通过上古传送阵，将南宫婉他们带到了乱星海去，然后略显神通占据了一座灵脉不错的偏僻小岛。让南宫婉等人定居下来，而韩立则再次返回天南坠魔谷，要开启了芥子空间，进入其中修炼元磁神光。



But before he entered the spatial pocket, he released his hidden fortune mansion, depositing his spirit beasts and insects there and arranging his medicine garden as well. The Profound Goddess’ Palm and the Dragon Scale Fruit were also placed within it.

> 在进入芥子空间之前，他将那座天机府放出，将噬金虫等灵虫灵兽存放其中，并修建好了一座药园，将从子母峰带出的玄天仙藤、龙鳞果树等移植进去。



Finally, he had the human-like puppet remain behind and gave it the small mysterious bottle, leaving the garden entirely in its care.

> 最后他又将人形傀儡留下，将神秘小交给对方，让其来负责照料这一切。



But he still felt ill at ease, fearing that cultivators would discover traces of him in the valley.

> 就这样他还有些不太放心，生怕有修士闯入内谷发现其行迹。



After a year of effort, he placed down a huge ancient formation that released a bewitching mist that manipulated a cultivator’s senses and perception, covering most of the valley depths with it.

> 就花费了年许时间，布置一个超巨型的上古奇阵，放出了可以扰乱修士神识和五感的迷雾，将内谷大半地方都笼罩其中。



Then with that finished, he gave his second Nascent Soul several commands and teleported into the spatial pocket through his formation.

> 做完这一切后，他给第二元婴下了几道命令后，人就通过传送阵进入到了芥子空间中。



Before he began cultivating, Han Li first refined the Golden Wyrm King’s core in accordance with the Soaring Sky Beast incarnation’s suggestion. Using a peculiar method, he turned it into a metal-attributed core spirit root, allowing him to refine the Divine Essencefused Light with greater ease.

> 在修炼之前，韩立先将那颗金蛟王的内丹，按照童子之言，特殊方法祭炼了一番，让其变成了一转化的金属性丹灵根，才安心的开始修炼元磁神光。



But Han Li and the boy couldn't have possibly known that this unintentional action solved the fatal flaw in cultivating the Divine Essensefused Light. This could be considered a brilliant stroke of luck.

> 韩立和那童子自然都没有想到，他们这个看似无意的举动，却正好解决了元磁神光修炼的致命缺陷。这也算是韩立福星高照了。



Otherwise, it would’ve taken Han Li over a hundred years of cultivation before he discovered something amiss. When that time came, even if he began cultivating again, the harm would be too great.

> 否则他真要浪费百余年时光，才会发现其中的蹊跷。到时即使再重头开始修炼，其中的弊处之大，可想而知了。



But even with this and the aid of the Essensefused Mountain, Han Li’s cultivation still didn’t go smoothly.

> 就算这样，韩立借助元磁山修炼的过程，也并不顺利。



The cultivation of the first several layers went well enough, breezing through them quickly with the aid of the mountain. But during the later stages, he would often run into bottlenecks and nearly undergo Qi deviation which would result in great harm to his vitality.

> 前边几层还好，因为借助了元磁山这里，修炼起来飞快。但是一到后边时，就开始频繁碰到瓶颈，并且数次差点走火入魔，大伤元气。



If it weren’t the countless spirit medicines in hand and that mysterious bottle, he feared his cultivation would’ve come to an end.

> 要不是他手中灵药无数，又有小瓶催熟，恐怕境界会因此大跌的。



Lastly, what caused him the most pain was cultivating the power of the five elements and the Essensefused Mountain, and fusing them together. For several tens of years, he wasn’t able to take a half-step away from the mountain where he experienced hardship that outsiders would never know.

> 最让人痛苦不堪的，却是自身修炼的五行之力和元磁山的元磁力融合一起，曾经一度数十年时间，根本无法离开元磁山半步，其中的艰辛不足为外人所知。



Had it not been for Han Li’s extreme wisdom and perseverance, he wouldn’t have been able to continue.

> 要不是韩立心智毅力都非比寻常，还真无法继续修炼下去。



As such, his diligent cultivation continued inside the spatial pocket for two hundred years. Eventually, his cultivation succeeded and the Essensefused Mountain was completely refined. He was able to take it into his body as a precious treasure.

> 就这样，他在芥子空间中苦苦修炼了二百多年后，终于将功法修炼大成，并且将元磁山彻底炼化，可以自行收入体内，反成了一件至宝。



It was now that things finally began to go smoothly.

> 下边的事情却开始顺利起来。



Han Li found an appropriate opportunity to take the Devil Essence PIlls and other spirit medicines. With the additional assistance of the peak grade spirit stones and five glacial flames, he succeeded in breaking through to the Deity Transformation stage.

> 韩立找了一个合适的时机，在服下“魔元丹”等多种灵药，并在极品灵石和五种极寒之焰的辅助下，终于一举突破化神初期成功，成了一名化神修士。



Now that he was a Deity Transformation cultivator, Han Li was able to manipulate worldly origin Qi, commanding wind and rain. His abilities were now on part with an Immortal god from the secular world. It could be said, he has completely elevated his existence. 

> 化神一成，韩立就可初步调动天地元气，呼风唤雨，神通几乎和世俗传闻中的神仙一流，并无不同。可谓一步登天了！



Han Li was overcome with joy and immediately departed from the valley, making his way to the Scattered Star Seas.

> 韩立心中大喜，之后立刻离开了坠魔谷，去乱星海一趟。



He discovered Nangong Wan and his disciples were safe and sound. His disciples even developed a significant faction in the Scattered Star Seas, directly controlling several tens of the nearby cultivator islands.

> 发现南宫婉和门西卡弟子均都安然无恙，门人甚至还在乱星海发展出了一处不小的势力，直接控制了附近数十余座大小不一的修士岛屿。



Nevertheless, he didn’t hold much of a strong opinion on this and remained neutral on the matter.

> 韩立对此并未有什么其他看法，一副不置可否的样子。



When Nangong Wang and his disciples saw that he truly entered Deity Transformation stage, they were overjoyed and threw a celebration. 

> 南宫婉和门下弟子见韩立成就了化神修士，自然也是大喜之极，着实庆祝了一番。



At that moment, with the aid of the large quantities of medicine pills Han Li left for her, Nangong Wan had already entered late-Nascent Soul stage. For the time being, she was strenuously cultivating so that she may one day reach the peak of late-stage and break through as well.

> 这时的南宫婉在他赠送的大量丹药辅助下，早已进阶后期修为了，正在苦苦修炼，争取能早日修炼到后期大成，也好同样做出突破。



Shi Jian was also a person possessing exceeding aptitude. After several hundred years, he also succeeded in condensing a Nascent Soul, much to Han Li’s joy.

> 而那石坚也资质着实过人，数百年时间一过，竟也凝结元婴成功了, 让韩立大感欣慰。



However, there was also misfortune during this time. Since Mu Peiling’s lifespan was approaching the end, she was in a rush to breakthrough to Nascent Soul-stage. As a result, her state of mind entering seclusion was unstable and her inner demons caused her death through a backlash of magic power.

> 但此期间也发生了一件不幸之事，多年齐纳，那慕沛灵因为寿元快到缘故，急于突破元婴瓶颈，结果在闭关时心境露出了一丝破绽，被那心魔趁虚而入，导致法力反噬陨落而亡。



When Han Li heard this, he was somewhat saddened.

> 韩立听到此消息心中一愣，有些黯然。



In preparation for her breakthrough to Nascent Soul stage, he also gifted her supplementary medicine made from the Ninecurl Spirit Ginseng, but her fate can only be said to be the will of the heavens.

> 此女突破元婴时，他同样赠送了九曲灵参丹药等辅助灵药，但当初仍然无法凝集元婴，只能说是天意所为了。



As she was his in-name concubine, Han Li naturally paid a visit to her grave.

> 作为他名义上的侍妾，韩立亲自去此女墓前拜祭了一番。



At that moment, Han Li arrived back on the main island and properly accompanied Nangong Wan for well over a decade before returning to the Heavenly South to continue his cultivation.

> 此后，韩立就此在岛上住下，好好陪同南宫婉十余年光景后，才再次离开岛屿，重新返回天南继续修炼。
