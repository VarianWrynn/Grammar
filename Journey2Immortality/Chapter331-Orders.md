After carefully putting away the items he procured from the Emperor, Han Li looked up toward the rainbow light and quickly flew to a corner of the bamboo forest. 

> 韩立将几样东西小心的收好之后，抬首望了望天上霞光，就飞身向竹林的一角跃去。



After a brief moment, Han Li arrived at a huge bamboo stalk with a formation flag stabbed into it and pulled the flag out.

> 片刻之后，韩立将插在一根插在巨竹根部的青色阵旗，拔了出来。



The rainbow light barrier immediately disappeared without a trace.

> 顿时，漫天的霞光禁制消失的无影无踪。



Han Li smiled faintly and flew off to another corner of the forest.

> 韩立微微一笑，转身向其他角落而去。



Soon after, Han Li left the bamboo forest, having retrieved all of the formation flags and plates with exceptional care.

> 不大会儿工夫，所有的阵旗和阵盘都被韩立从竹林中起了出来，被其珍惜异常的收进了储物袋。



After experiencing the might of the improved “Five Elements Reversal Formation”, Han Li had come to value it far more than before.

> 在见识过这新改进的“颠倒五行阵”的威力后，韩立对此可宝贝之极啊。



When Han Li calmly walked out of the bamboo forest, something caught his eye: the pulverized corpse of the Emperor of Yue. It seemed that when the rainbow light had disappeared, the body had fallen onto the ground.

> 当韩立不慌不忙的回到了原地，想要御器来开此地时，却在地面上望见了一样东西，竟是那如同烂泥一样的越皇尸体。看来霞光一散，它也从天上掉落了下来。



Han Li wrinkled his bow and let out a sigh. He then shot a fist-sized fireball toward the corpse, turning it to ash.

> 韩立皱了皱眉，微微叹息一声，手指一弹，一个拳头大小的火球飞了过去，将越皇的尸体化为了灰烬。



Han Li would have lamented if the ashes of such a remarkable character had been blown into the wind after death. As such, Han Li patted his storage pouch, and a streak of golden light flew out, blasting a large hole in the ground.

> 此位也算是个了不起的人物了，可死后也只是一堆飞灰而已，这让韩立感叹不已！随后，韩立往储物袋上一拍，一道金光飞出，在一侧的空地上击出了一个大坑出来。



Han Li then lightly waved his sleeve, sweeping the ashes into the hole with a gentle gust of wind.

> 然后韩立用衣袖轻轻一拂，那堆尸灰便被一股柔风一吹，全都稳妥的送进了坑内。



Suddenly, white light flashed. Just as Han Li thought to close the hole, he paused.

> 突然白光一闪，韩立原本想要掩埋的动作，立即停了下来。



With amazement, Han Li beckoned with his hand, causing an embroidered cloth to fly from the ashes and into his hand.

> 他惊诧的单手一招，一块白濛濛的锦帕，从坑中轻飘飘的飞出，落入了其手上。



“This is...” Han Li took a quick look at it with curiosity.

> “这是……”韩立双目略一扫过，露出了疑惑的之色。



This embroidered cloth was slightly yellow and appeared to be ancient. He did not know what it was made from, but it emitted a faint glimmering light. Han Li suspected that the embroidery was actually an indistinct map.

> 此锦帕略微发黄，一看就是年代极远之物，不知何物织成，竟通体散发着淡淡的荧光。但让韩立狐疑的是，这上面竟然绣着一副模糊不清的地图。



Han Li’s curiosity was piqued and he hastily examined the map. After looking through it several times, he then lost all interest.

> 韩立好奇心大起，急忙的细看此地图，结果翻来覆去的看了数遍后，就失去了兴趣。



This was because after careful examination, it was certain to not be any terrain in the State of Yue as it was particularly unfamiliar. The drawing should be of a strange land. Furthermore, the cloth was clearly damaged and incomplete. He wasn’t sure if it was even half of the original map or merely a tiny piece.

> 因为仔细看过之后了，他就肯定这绝对不是越国的地形，画的应该是一个陌生的地方。而且地图明显残缺不全，不知是完整地图的一半，还是几分之一啊！



However, since the map only appeared after the Emperor of Yue had turned to ash, it seemed he had used some sort of secret technique to conceal it within his body. Else, his puppet beasts would’ve found it from the start.

> 不过，这地图现在才从灰烬中发现，看来应该是那越皇用某种秘法藏在了体内，否则一开始就应该被兽傀儡发现了。



From this, it appeared that the map was extremely important!

> 如此看来，此地图还非同小可啊！



Han Li pondered for a moment before deciding to store the badly damaged map into the jade box along with the Five Elements Blood Cores.

> 韩立若有所思的想着，就将这残缺地图收在了装五行丹的玉匣内。



Now was not the time to unravel this mystery. He had to hurry and find the others. After all, with the Emperor of Yue dead, the aftermath would be quite troublesome!

> 现在可不是解谜的时间，还是赶紧找其他人吧！毕竟越皇挂了，这善后之事还真有点头痛的！



When Han Li found Chen Qiaoqian and the others in front of the Cold Palace, he was met with some unfortunate news.

> 当韩立在冷宫前，找到了陈巧倩几人时，又一个不太好的消息传来。



They discovered Wu Xuan’s corpse within the Black Fiend School Master’s private room; he had recently died as a blood sacrifice and had his blood essence absorbed.

> 在冷宫的黑煞教主密室内，他们发现了“武炫”的尸体，不久前才被血祭吸尽了精血而亡。



When Han Li heard this, he was startled. But then he smiled bitterly and remained silent.

> 韩立听了此事，先是一愣，但马上苦笑了一声，什么话也没说。



Because of this matter with the Black Fiend School, many of his own sect’s Foundation Establishment cultivators had died. When Han Li returned, his master, Li Huayuan, definitely wouldn’t look at him favorably. After all, this matter was brought up because of him!

> 如今，因为黑煞教的事情，一下让本门阵亡这么多筑基期修士，回去之后，恐怕李化元不会给自己好脸色了。事情终究是他引起来的啊！



After wallowing in the feeling of helplessness, Han Li bluntly passed the responsibility of dealing with the aftermath to Chen Qiaoqian and Zhong Weiniang. He then found an excuse to return first to the Qin Residence.

> 韩立大感无奈之后，干脆将善后的事情交予了陈巧倩和钟卫娘几人处理，自己则找了个借口，就先回到了秦宅。



However, Han Li completely had not expected that as soon as he returned, he would meet an entirely unexpected visitor.

……

> 可是他万万没想到的是，刚一回到住处，一个意想不到的人出现在了其眼前。……



“Greetings to Martial Uncle Han!” A middle-aged man wearing embroidered clothes saluted him.“Martial Nephew Ma! Why have you come to find me so late? Has something important happened?” Han Li’s eye’s flashed with confusion.

> 拜见韩师叔！”眼前的锦衣中年人恭敬的施礼道。“马师侄啊！这么晚来找我，有什么重要事情？”韩立眼中闪过一丝惊疑之色。



Han Li, who had just returned from the Forbidden City of Yue, did not expect to find the disciple responsible for contacting the sect from Yuejing to be waiting for him in his courtyard.

> 此时韩立刚从皇城赶回，没想到这位负责越京联络的本门弟子，竟就在院内等着自己了。



Furthermore, it appeared the disciple had been waiting for quite a long time.

> 而且看情形，等候的时间可不短了。



“Martial Uncle, this one has just received news of an order. All Foundation Establishment disciples must hurry to the Seven Sect’s main barracks at the border. The enemy has delivered a war ultimatum. In two months, the Six Devil Dao Sects will have a battle for supremacy with the Seven Sects of Yue. For this, all hands are to return to the battlefield. In addition, Martial Ancestor Li has sent a message to you!” The embroidered-clothed man solemnly said and handed a writ and jade slip over to Han Li.

> “师叔，在下刚刚接到消息。上面有令，所有筑基期以上弟子，都必须马上赶往边界的七派大营，对方已经下了决战书了，两个月后魔道六宗要和我们决一雌雄了。上面要求收缩所有的人手。另外同时来的，还有李师祖的一枚信简！”锦衣人郑重的说道。



When Han Li heard this, he was slightly startled, but he still maintained his calm expression as he took the two items and carefully examined them.

> 说完，他就掏出一封手令和一枚玉简递给了韩立。韩立听了微微一惊，但不动声色的接过了两物，仔细审视起来。



The writ’s orders were exactly as he had been told. All Foundation Establishment cultivators out on missions are required to assemble at the border camp within a month of receiving the writ and the date of the decisive battle had already been determined. The spiritual signature at the end of the writ was also genuine.

> 手令上的命令的确和对方说的内容一样，要求所有在外执行任务筑基期弟子，必须在接到手令之日起的一个月内，赶到边界营地集合，和魔道决战的日期定好了。而手令最后的灵徽标记，也的确不假。



Having finished reading the writ, Han Li submerged his spiritual sense into the jade slip.

> 验完手令，韩立就把神识深入了玉简内。



A hollow image of Li Huayuan appeared within and spoke very plainly. He merely instructed that Han Li no longer needed to protect the Qin Residence and that Han Li along with his other disciples were to return to the border. He had previously received information that the Devil Dao’s plan to infiltrate the State of Yue’s secular world and wreak havoc was canceled for some unknown reason. 

> 结果，在其内出现了李化元的虚影，其所说简单异常。只是吩咐秦宅不用再保护了，因为已得到消息，这次魔道潜入越国世俗界兴风作浪的计划，不知为何取消了。韩立和其他弟子可以放心的返回边界。



When Han Li heard the few words of Li Huayuan’s hollow image, he was vexed to the point of spitting out blood. Han Li strongly suppressed the sullenness in his heart and withdrew his consciousness from the slip.

> 听着李化元虚影的寥寥数语，韩立却懊恼的大有吐血的感觉。他强压着心头的郁闷，才将心神退了出来。



After a moment of thought, Han Li looked at the items in his hands and said, “Leave behind the writ and jade slip. I will inform the others about this!”

> “我知道此事了，你将手令和玉简留下，我会通知他人的！”韩立望了望手上的东西，想了想后说道。



The middle-aged man hesitated for a moment before respectfully replying, “Then, I will have to trouble Senior Uncle!”. He then took his leave.

> “那麻烦师叔了！”中年人犹豫了一下，还是恭谨的答道。接着，其就向韩立告辞了。



Han Li didn’t speak any further and watched as the middle-aged man departed. Afterwards, he softly exhaled and slowly returned to his room.

> 韩立轻轻一句不送，就目睹此人飞走了。然后，他才轻吐了一口气，缓缓推门进了屋子。



……On the morning of the second day, Han Li and the others sat in the guest hall and discussed their departure from Yuejing.

> ……第二天早上，韩立、宋蒙等几人坐在客厅内，商量着离开越京之事。



“Before I can travel to the border camp and participate in the great battle, I must first pay a visit to my clan. Thus, I will not be able to travel together with you all.” Not long after she read the writ, Chen Qiaoqian said this as she lightly bit on her lips.

> “在参加大战前，我要先回家族一趟，然后再去营地！所以就不和几位一齐同行了。”在看过手令不久，陈巧倩就轻咬红唇的说道。



“I must deliver Senior Martial Brother Liu’s remains back to his clan.” Zhong Weiniang said with a haggard appearance and slightly red eyes. Although it wasn’t explicitly said, all the others undoubtedly intended to travel alone as well.

> “我要把刘师兄的遗物，送还给刘氏家族！”钟卫娘面容有些憔悴，双眼微红的说道。虽然没有明说，但同样单独行动的意思，表露无疑。



“I have no plans, so I’ll travel together with Junior Martial Brother Han.” Song Meng was quite forthright and patted the shoulder of Han Li beside him.

> “我倒没什么事，韩师弟我们一齐回去吧。”宋蒙倒是非常看的开，轻拍了一下身边的韩立肩头，豪爽的说道。



“Fourth Senior Martial Brother, I can’t! I also have a few personal matters to attend to.” Han Li had previously made plans and declined Song Meng with a slight smile.

> “不了，四师兄！我也有点私事要处理的”早就另有打算的韩立，微笑着拒绝了。



“Let’s forget about it then!” Song Meng appeared very disappointed

> “这样啊，那就算了吧！”宋蒙露出很失望的样子。



“How about I accompany Junior Martial Brother Song?” Chen Qiaoqian’s sole surviving Senior Martial Brother said to Song Meng with a smile.

> “要不，我陪宋师弟一起回去吧！”陈巧倩唯一幸存下来的师兄，忽然冲宋蒙一笑的说道。



Song Meng’s spirits were immediately raised. Now, he would have someone to swap pointers with along the way.

> 宋蒙顿时大喜，如此一来路上就有人切磋一二了。



When Han Li saw this, he couldn’t help but inwardly laugh! He didn’t think that after such a bloody battle, his Fourth Senior Martial Brother would stay completely the same.

> 韩立看此，心里哑然失笑！没想到经过这次血战，这位四师兄还是一点改变没有。



With that, everyone agreed that on the morning of the next day, they would go their separate ways.

> 就这样，众人约好了明日一早，大家各奔东西。



By late afternoon, Han Li had already informed Qin Yan that the danger had come to pass and he would be departing the next day.

> 到了下午，韩立去和那秦言讲明了他们已安全的事情，然后在其大喜之中，说了明日告辞的话语。



Qing Yan revealed great happiness at the news, but hastily said a few words urging Han Li to stay as a guest. Han Li refused with a faint smile, so Qin Yan could only drop the subject.

> 秦言听了此话，连忙说了一些挽留的话语，但韩立淡笑着拒绝了。对方见此，也只好作罢！



After speaking with Qin Yan, Han Li returned to his residence.

> 从秦言那里出来后，韩立往住处走去。



But he didn’t expect that in an unavoidable garden on the way back, he would encounter Chen Qiaoqian wearing a white skirt with her back to him.

> 可没想到，在路过必经的小花园时，那陈巧倩背对着他，身穿白裙的出现在了那里。



As she was admiring the flowers, she just happened to be blocking his path.

> 仿佛正欣赏着花草，而恰好挡住了他的去路。



Having seen this, Han Li was a bit surprised and found it embarrassing to silently pass by her. 

> 见到这种情形，韩立微微一怔，自然不好意思一声不响的就过去了。



“Senior Martial Sister Chen, what a coincidence!” Han Li found a casual encounter preferable to just passing her by.

> “陈师姐，这么巧啊！”韩立神色如常的招呼道，然后就想与其擦肩而过。



However, Chen Qiaoqian suddenly straightened her back and turned around to face Han Li with an appearance as dainty as a flower.

> 但是陈巧倩，突然柳腰扭动，身形轻轻一转，一张娇艳如花的面孔就面向了韩立。



“It isn’t a coincidence! I was waiting for you here!” Chen Qiaoqian spoke, slightly opening her almond-shaped lips.

> “不是巧！我是专门等你的！”陈巧倩杏唇微张的说道。



With a complicated expression on her face, she stared at Han Li with her autumn-colored eyes.

> 她的一双秋眸，直直的注视着韩立，脸上露出一种复杂的神色。



“Waiting... for me?” Han Li looked astonished.

> “等我……”韩立恰当的露出一点惊愕之色。



Although he did not know why, he felt both bitterness and joy in his heart.

> 可心里却不知为何，既有些苦涩，也有些喜悦。



After a moment of silence, Chen Qiaoqian spoke a few words that left Han Li astonished. “I heard that the White Chrysanthemum Mountains at the outskirts of Yuejing were gorgeous and one of the nearby marvels. Would Junior Martial Brother Han accompany me there to sightsee?” 

> “听说越京郊外的白菊山，艳丽非常，是附近的一大奇景。韩师弟陪我过去看看好吗？”陈巧倩默然了一会儿后，竟说出了一句让韩立大感意外的话来。



“Sure!” Han Li had originally intended to refuse, but upon seeing the sorrow in her eyes, he had reflexively agreed. Was this the doing of the gods?

> “好的！”不知是不是鬼使神差！韩立原本想要拒绝的话语，但在一接触对方眼中的哀怨之意时，竟不知不觉的改了口。



When Chen Qiaoqian heard Han Li agree, her face slightly blushed, revealing a happy expression; it complimented her incomparable beauty. “That is great, Junior Martial Brother Han! Let’s go now. If we wait until after the sun sets, we won’t see anything.”

> “太好了，韩师弟！我们现在就走吧。等到太阳落山，可就什么都看不到了。”陈巧倩听到韩立同意的话语，脸上升起了一丝红晕，露出了欣喜之色，更衬得其艳丽无双。
