Immediately after Han Li agreed to accompany Chen Qianqiao, he felt slight regret.

> 韩立话一出口，就有点后悔了。



He had previously came to a clear decision to no longer be tangled with this woman. But now, he had agreed to accompany her for some unknown reason. It seemed he wasn’t as determined as he had thought!

> 他明明早已拿定了主意，不再和此女纠缠不清的，可如今竟莫名的答应此女了。看来，他的心志还是不行啊！



Han Li inwardly shook his head and replied, “Alright. Then how about Senior Martial Sister ride with me in my Divine Wind Boat. We’ll be able to arrive there much faster!”

> 这样想着，韩立暗暗摇了摇头，嘴上却答应道：“行，那师姐就乘坐我的神风舟去吧，这样可以快去快回！”



With that said, Han Li took out his spotless white Divine Wind Boat and invited Chen Qianqiao to ride with him.

> 韩立说完，就将洁白的神风舟放了出来，请陈巧倩一同上去。



When Chen Qiaoqian saw this gesture, she smiled sweetly and entered the boat without any objections.

> 陈巧倩见了，嫣然一笑，没有客气的上了此舟。



After a moment of flight, Han Li brought Chen Qiaoqian to the Yuejing’s famed White Chrysanthemum Mountain.

> 于是，韩立带陈巧倩御器飞走，一会儿的工夫后，就到了在越京名气不小的白菊山。



The mountain was covered with all sorts of chrysanthemums, a majority being white. The scene was truly mesmerizing.

> 此山满山遍野开满了各种各样的菊花，多以白色为主，果然景色迷人之极。



Contrary to Han Li’s expectations, Chen Qiaoqian didn’t speak to him after arriving on the mountain. They merely walked along the small mountain path minding their own business. Only when they occasionally saw a particularly breathtaking scene would they stop for a moment.

> 大出乎韩立意外的是，到了此山后陈巧倩并没有和他说什么话，只是自顾自的沿着小路上山而行，偶尔碰上特别喜爱的景色，则驻步多停留一会儿。



Han Li did not speak as he followed behind her, dispassionately gazing at her charming body without the slightest shame.

> 跟在其后的韩立，同样没有开口，但是望着其楚楚动人的身影，却有些愣头愣脑的，一副根本不解风情的样子。



After two hours, Chen Qiaoqian had climbed to the mountaintop and stood on a small pavilion with Han Li to the side.

> 一个时辰后，陈巧倩就登上了山顶，并站在一个小亭子中，四处眺望了起来。而韩立站在了一侧。



At that moment, no one was on the mountaintop aside from the two; not even a single traveler. As the two were unwilling to speak, it was extremely quiet.

> 这时，山顶上除了韩立两人外，竟一个游客都没有，再加上两人谁都不愿先开口，更显得寂静之极。



It was unknown how long this subtle mood continued before Chen Qiaoqian broke it with a few faint words.

> 这种微妙的气氛也不知维持了多久，终于陈巧倩传来了幽幽的一句话。



“Junior Martial Brother Han, after the great battle is concluded, I fear that I am going to be married off!”

> “韩师弟，大战结束后，我恐怕就要嫁人了！”:sob:



Upon hearing those words, Han Li couldn’t help but tilt his head and reveal an expression of astonishment.

> 听到此话，韩立一怔，不禁侧脸望去，露出了吃惊之色。:open_mouth:



“The groom is a direct lineage disciple of the great Qin cultivator clan, a disciple of Heavenly Imperial Fortress and a cultivator that has just reached Foundation Establishment! I’ve seen him several times and he seems decent. If nothing unexpected occurs, then he will marry into my Chen Clan and become my Dao Companion.” Chen Qiaoqian spoke calmly and turned a blind eye to Han Li’s appearance of amazement.

> “对方是另一个修仙大族秦家的直系弟子，拜在天阙堡门下，也是刚筑基没多久的修士！我见了几次，人还不错的样子。若是没什么意外的话，他就会入赘我们陈家，从此成为我的双修伴侣。”陈巧倩对韩立的愕然之色，视若无睹，不紧不慢的的淡淡说道。



After a moment, Han Li’s astonishment gradually waned, and with some hesitation, he politely said, “Then I must congratulate Senior Martial Sister Chen on finding a suitable marriage partner! Junior Martial Brother will certainly prepare a gift for you later....!”

> 此时，韩立的惊色渐渐褪去，迟疑了一下，客气的说道：“那恭喜陈师姐喜结良缘了！回头师弟一定备上一份……！”



It became clear as Han Li started to speak, that Chen Qiaoqian had no intention of listening to his words; those were not the words she had wanted to hear. She trembled for a moment before releasing a disk shaped flying magic tool and flying off with a cold face.

> 韩立只说了个开头，可显然这并不是对方想要听到的话语。她颤抖了一下，未等韩立说完，就冷着脸的一扬手，一件圆盘器扔出，人竟自顾自的御器飞走了，仿佛再没有什么可留恋的了。



After seeing Chen Qiaoqian disappear into the distance, Han Li motionlessly stood in place with a cold expression. After a long while, he let out a long breath and dispiritedly flew off.

> 望着陈巧倩消失的方向，韩立神色冷冷的站在原地一动不动，半晌之后，才长长的出了一口气，没精打采的飞走了。



Although Han Li had already made his decision about Chen Qiaoqian, he still felt at a loss when confronted with her interest to marry him. 

> 虽然心中早打定了主意，但见对自己有意的女子，真要另作他妇了，韩立还是有些失落的感觉。



This was perhaps a common flaw that all men possessed! Even if they were called cultivators, they had the same emotions as mortals.

> 这也许是所有男人的通病吧！他们虽然名为修仙者，但在情感上和凡人是一样的。



Han Li mocked himself as he flew back to the Qin Residence.

> 韩立一边自嘲的想着，一边飞回了秦宅。



After returning to the residence, Han Li learned from the others that Chen Qiaoqian had already departed, starting her journey early.

> 但刚回到住处，就从其他人口中得知，陈巧倩竟已离开了此地，先走了一步。



When Han Li heard this, he bitterly smiled in his heart. It seemed that he had greatly disappointed Chen Qiaoqian, and now, she was preparing her heart to marry someone else.

> 韩立听了心里苦笑了一下，看来陈巧倩真的对他失望之极，准备安心的嫁他人了。



Although he was a tad depressed, Han Li wasn’t of the normal sort. With an ordinary expression, he nodded his head and joked around with the others for a while longer.

> 虽然有些惆怅，但韩立毕竟不是一般之辈，脸上只是如常的点点头，就继续和他人有说有笑的过了半日。



Like that, the morning of the second day had arrived and the others left the Qin Residence. Han Li was the last cultivator to remain.

> 就这样，第二日一早，其他人先后离开了秦宅，韩立最后一个才离去的。



Before setting off on his journey, he went to secretly pay a visit to Mo Fengwu. After all, they were acquaintances and he wanted to bid her farewell.

> 只是在出发前，他特意的偷偷看了下墨凤舞，毕竟相识了一场，他打算告辞一下的。



But when he arrived outside her home, Han Li spotted Mo Fengwu through a window, causing him to change his mind.

> 但当在阁楼外的空中，隔着窗户真望见了墨凤舞时，韩立又改变了见一面再走的想法。



This was because Mo Fengwu was accompanying an old woman of about fifty years old that was reading scriptures out loud. She appeared completely at peace.

> 因为少妇打扮的墨凤舞，在楼内正陪着一位五十许岁的老妇人在诵读经书，脸庞上满是平静安详之色。



After Han Li silently looked on for a moment, he ultimately decided not to disturb her. He turned around and quietly left.

> 韩立默默的望了一会儿后，最终没有惊动对方，而转身悄然离去。



Toward this particular girl, it may be better if he didn’t meet her!

> 对此女来说，也许不见的话，会更好一些！



‘Perhaps living a peaceful life without being reminded of those painful memories is best for her!’ Han Li thought with melancholy.

> 省得让其回想起那些痛苦的事情，可能这种平静无争的生活，才是此女最向往的吧！韩立有些惆怅的想道。



Han Li then left Yuejing and first made a trip to Jia Yuan City. Since he had promised to avenge the Mo Estate, he figured that he may as well pay a visit and take a look.

> 韩立离开了越京，稍微兜了个圈子，先去了嘉元城，不管怎么他既然承诺帮墨府报仇的事情，怎么也要顺便去看一眼了。



Although the Devil Dao hadn’t come to stir trouble, he reckoned that Jia Yuan City didn’t currently contain any high level cultivators due to the upcoming great battle. He only had to secretly get rid of the Rainbow Sect’s Sect Master. Even if he angered a few Spirit Beast Mountain disciples, they wouldn’t be able to find out it was him.

> 现在虽然没有魔道之人来搅局了，但大战在即，估计城内应该不会有什么高阶修士做阵了。他只要神不知鬼不觉的将那位五色门之主干掉，想必即使灵兽山的人再气恼，也根本找不到他的头上。



In addition to causing trouble for the Rainbow Sect, he thought he’d take a look to see how Sun Ergou was managing the Fourth Level Gang.

> 不过，他此趟除了要找那五色门的麻烦，还想看看那孙二狗将四平帮经营的如何了。想必这些年来，其在曲魂的协助之下，应该有些作为才是。



He had left behind this back up plan several years ago, and now, he wanted to see if it still held any use.

> 而这个当年他所留的后路，现在看起来还是没什么用的。



With that in mind, Han Li rushed toward Jia Yuan City on his Divine Wind Boat.

> 韩立心存这样的打算，就坐在神风舟上直奔嘉元城而来。



The last time he was in Jia Yuan City was over ten years ago. However, many of the memories remained vivid in his mind and left a deep impression on him.   ……

> 说起来，他上次来嘉元城还是十余年前的事情了，可是许多事情仍历历在目，印象深刻之极。……



Five days later, a youth appeared in front of a long established restaurant in Jia Yuan City. This person stood on the side of the street and looked at the restaurant's sign with squinted eyes. 

> 五日后，嘉元城的老字号酒楼“香家酒楼”前，来了一位青衫的年轻人。这人站在楼前的街道上，眯着眼睛望着酒楼的招牌，



The person with the strange expression was Han Li, who had just entered the city. After standing there for a moment, he sighed and calmly walked in.

> 神色颇有些古怪，正是刚进城不久的韩立。韩立站在那里，感慨了一番后，才不慌不忙的抬腿进去了。



He went to the second floor and saw that the table by the window where he had sat at all those years ago happened to be empty.

> 说来也巧，他一上了二楼，一眼就看到了当日坐过的那个靠窗的桌子，竟然空无一人。



Han Li happily walked over to it without the slightest hesitation.

> 韩立欣喜之下，毫不犹豫的走了过去。



Just as he sat down, a waiter politely wiped down his table and asked Han Li what he would like to order.

> 他刚坐下，酒楼的小二就殷勤的上来擦抹桌子，并问韩立想要点些什么酒菜。



Han Li faintly smiled and ordered a few delicious appetizers, sending the waiter off to deliver his order. However, he did not come here just to satisfy his desire for delicious food.

> 韩立微微一笑，随便点了几样可口的小菜，就让小儿下去了。他来此地，可不是仅想满足口腹之欲的。



With that in mind, Han Li turned his gaze outside the window.

> 想到这里，韩立的目光向窗外望去。



The Mo Estate’s huge residence still remained and it still had a burly man standing outside its gates. However, the huge sign on the gate no longer read “Mo Residence” but instead read “Li Residence” in large, golden words.

> 当日的墨府巨宅依旧存在，同样有一些彪形大汉，站在府门前。只不过大门上的巨大牌匾，挂的不再是“墨府”了，而变成了“李府”两个斗大的金字。



Looking at the “Li Residence” sign shining under the sunlight, Han Li unconsciously wrinkled his brow.

> 韩立望着在阳光下，闪闪发光的“李府”牌匾，眉头不经意的皱了一下。



From what he had heard, the Rainbow Sect Master seemed to be surnamed “Li”. It seems they now occupied their defeated enemy’s nest.

> 据他所知，五色门门主好像就姓“李”的，看来他们直接鸠占鹊巢了。



Not knowing why, Han Li felt particularly bothered when he saw the sign saying “Li Residence”. He found the previous “Mo Residence” sign somewhat more pleasing to the eye.

> 不知为何，韩立望着牌匾上的“李府”两字，总觉得特别的碍眼，好像还是以前的墨府招牌，更让他觉得顺眼一些。



As Han Li was lost in thought, his dishes were brought by the waiter and simultaneously the sounds of banter were heard on the floor below. Several youths wearing embroidered silk clothes walked up the stairs followed by their burly guards; they appeared to be the young masters of a noble family. 

> 韩立正想着呢，小二就麻利的将酒菜上好了。而就在这时，楼下传来一番说笑之声，接着从楼梯口处上来了数名年轻人，全都是身穿锦衣绫罗，一副贵家公子的打扮，后面还跟着几名膀大腰圆的家丁。



Among these young masters was a man so thin he might blow away in the wind. He casually swept his gaze over the floor and impolitely beckoned to the waiter.

> 这几名公子哥样的人物，在楼上随意的瞟了几眼，其中一名干瘦的仿佛一阵风就能吹走的人，不客气的冲那店小二一招手。



The waiter complacently ran over and hastily said with an enchanting smile, “Young Master Xia, do you have any instructions?”

> 店小二立即屁颠屁颠的跑了过去，并一脸媚笑的急忙说道：“夏少爷，你老人家有什么吩咐吗？”



“Call for the shopkeeper. Today, we’re inviting an esteemed guest to dine with us. Have everyone on the third floor leave. We will pay for the damages.” This skinny man spoke quite arrogantly.

> “叫你们掌柜的来，今天我们几个要请一位贵客吃酒，让三楼不相干的人赶紧走，有什么损失我们全包了。”这位长的这般瘦小，可口气倒大的很。



The waiter didn’t reveal the slightest bit of dissatisfaction, repeatedly nodding his head, before hurrying off to inform the shopkeeper.

> 可是这小二没有露出丝毫不满之意，连连点头称是，就忙去通知掌柜的去了。



After a short moment, a forty year old man arrived. Once he saw the thin man, he immediately agreed to his request with a smile. He then brought the waiter to the third floor to apologize to the customers who were already there.

> 片刻之后，一位四十许岁的中年人，上楼来了。一见这几位，就陪着笑的马上应承这几人的要求，然后就带着小二往三楼赔罪去了。



It was unknown whether this shopkeeper was naturally so quick and efficient or whether this young master had a truly great background.

> 也不知，是这位掌柜精明能干，还是这几位公子哥的名头真的不小。



Not long after, all of the customers on the third floor had paid their bills and left. Not a single one of them had dared to complain.

> 不一会儿工夫后，三楼用饭的一些客人，纷纷结账走人了，竟没有一人敢露什么怨意。



Han Li lazily looked over before he returned his gaze to the bustling streets outside the window.

> 韩立见此，只是懒洋洋的望了几人几眼，就仍把目光投向窗外的街道处。



The newcomer was only a young master among mortals, an arrogant person only relying on the might of his clan, commonly found at all places. Han Li had absolutely no interest in him.

> 只是一些凡人中的公子哥罢了，在世俗界这样依靠家中势力嚣张跋扈的人，哪里都有的。韩立可没什么心思注意他们的。



At that moment, the youth in charge, Young Master Xia, then nodded with satisfaction and descended to the ground floor.

> 此刻，以那位夏少爷为首的年轻人，这才满意的点点头，然后就纷纷下去接什么人去了。



Later, the sound of footsteps came up from below. This time, Han Li was startled and couldn’t help but turn his head around and stare.

> 过了一会儿，脚步声再次从楼下响起，而这次韩立微微一怔，不禁扭头回望了几眼。



This was because among those heavy footsteps, feather-light footsteps could be faintly discerned. Only a Jianghu martial artist who practiced [qinggong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinggong) to a certain stage would be able to display such control.

> 因为，在那些沉重的脚步声中，明显有一个人轻飘飘的，仿佛若有若无。这分明江湖中人，轻功到了一定火候后，才能有此表现的。



This greatly piqued Han Li’s curiosity.

> 这让韩立有点好奇了。
