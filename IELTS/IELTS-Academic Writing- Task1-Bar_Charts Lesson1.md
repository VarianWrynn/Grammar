### 2.1  An example

The bar chart shows the distribution of students by gender across six art-based disciplines at a UK university in 2011.

Generally speaking, the chart shows that while females outnumber males in most disciplines, the gender gap for each subject was not significant with the notable exception of Philosophy, where females students outnumbered their male counterparts by almost three to one.

Regarding male enrollment, Art and Design was the only subject with more men than women at a ratio of 120 to 90.

### 2.2 (S1:)  Analyze and group the information
> Analyze the chart and plan how to group the information

| Group |  DEetails   |  
| :-------- | :--------| 
| **First grouping**<br>(Body paragraph 1) |   **Male enrollment[^1]:**<br><br> **Language-base**: <br> -  English lang. & lit:230;<br> - Comm. & Media:210 <br> - Linguistics:180; <br><br> **Philosophy**:(the lowest)50|  
| **Second grouping**(Body paragraph 2) |   **Female entrollment** <br><br> **Language-base**: <br> -  English lang. & lit:250;<br> - Comm. & Media:220 <br> - Linguistics:240; <br><br> **Hist. & Arch**:(the lowest)120|  


[^1]: Find information that stands out: The value is highest and lowest. And here, we are not going to talk about the **Art and Design**, **History and Archeology**, because those are midrange, they don't have anything to do with ***language learning*** and there aren't the lowest.



- Art & Design is the one that the male outnumber femail
- Philosophy is the largest gender gap in all items.
- We don't mention the things in the midrange,
