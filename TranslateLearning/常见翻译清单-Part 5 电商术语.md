## 2. Stock vs Inventory

- Inventory is a raw material used for making the product, work in progress goods, and finished product. In other words, the inventory includes finished product ready to sell, work in progress goods which are not fully converted, and raw material which is required to create the product. 
-  Stock is a finished product ready to sell into a marketplace. Stock can also have raw material if the company sells raw material to customers.
-  In layman’s terms, stock and inventory are used interchangeably but for **accounting** purposes these two things are different. 
-  From an **analyst’s point of view**, it matters a lot what is stock and what is inventory because both things give a different view of the company’s financials.
