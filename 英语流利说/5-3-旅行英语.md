Disney is known for its stunning amusement. We visited Pirates of the Caribbean,Alice in Wonderland, Seven dwarf mine cars, The Frozen theatrical events and many other spots. We didn't ~~event~~ even have ~~a~~ time for resting up. All of the amusements left us an incredible ~~memory~~ memories.

The most impressive spot was Zion National Park. The view there was breathtaking, especially the stunning rust-colored mountains. Oh, we ran into some tourists from China there. You know, it was great to exchange our traveling experience sand tips in our native language. l took a lot of photos during the trip. After l came back, l uploaded them with some notes onto my travelblog,so that l can look back on these travel moments from time to time.
