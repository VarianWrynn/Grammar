## **Stages of Negotiating**

A negotiation is a discussion between people who want to reach an agreement.

When the negotiating a business deal or a salary, a negotiation will normally go through five stages.

### **1. Planning**

Before entering a negotiation, negotiators must plan and prepare their positions.

In the planning stage, negotiators will research the other side’s position and anticipate **where** they may agree or disagree. They will also set goals, establish their bottom line, and research the other side.

------

### **2. Clarifying [ˈklærəfaɪɪŋ] [ˈklærəfaɪ]**

During the clarifying stage, negotiators will contact each other to clarify what they want to achieve.

By discovering what the other side wants, both parties can see if they share common goals. Once their needs have been clarified **[ˈklærəfaɪd]**, the negotiations can begin.

------

The clarifying stage is used to obtain information from the other side and discover what outcome they **aim to achieve**.

### **3. Bargaining**

During the bargaining stage, negotiators **make compromises** until an agreement is reached.

They often aim for an outcome that benefits both sides without giving up too much.

------

In the bargaining stage, each side **adjusts their position** until an agreement is reached.

### **4. Settling**

In the settling stage, negotiators reach an agreement and decide how to implement it.

After the terms of an agreement have been decided, a contract will be drafted and signed. If an agreement can’t be reached, negotiators may find a third party for advice.

------

If an agreement isn’t reached in the settling stage, a third party may need to **mediate**.

### **5. Implementing**

In the implementation stage, an agreement or contract **is** **put** **into** **effect**. Implementing an agreement strengthens the relationship between both parties.

If both parties follow through on the agreement, it will be easier to negotiate next time.

------

Once an agreement has been implemented successfully, it will be easier to negotiate in the future.

## **Negotiating Terms**

### **1. Anchor point**

An anchor point is a reference point that negotiations are centered around. It is the best outcome that one side hopes to achieve.

Normally, the first offer made during a negotiation serves as the anchor point. Negotiators try to anchor the negotiation to their advantage to gain the upper land.

### **2. Bottom line**

A bottom line is the worst outcome that one side will accept. If someone is pushed beyond their bottom line, they may walk away from the negotiation.

------

To avoid an unfair deal, you should decide your bottom line before entering a negotiation.

### **3. BATNA**

NATNA stands for “Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement”. It is the second best option a side may have in a negotiation.

A BATNA can be used as an alternative if an agreement can’t be reached. When one side has a good BATNA, they can make fewer compromises, so they have more power.

------

If your alternative is better than an offer, you could leave the negotiation.

Having a strong BATNA allows you to delegate **determine** if an agreement **is worth accepting.**

### **4. Leverage**

Leverage is the power that one side has to influence another. If you have more leverage in a negotiation, you can persuade people to accept your terms.

Typically, the side most in need of an agreement has the least amount of leverage.

------

The more leverage you have, **the stronger your position will be**.

### **5. Deadlock**

In a deadlock, neither side is willing to compromise and no agreement can be made.

A deadlock happens when one side pursues its own interest instead of mutually beneficial terms. To break a deadlock, negotiators must find a win-win outcome.

------

They broke the deadlock by offering a large concession to the other side.

### **6. Concession**

A concession is a compromise that’s made in order to reach an agreement. Making concessions allows both sides to get part of what they want.

But giving too many concessions may make one side seem weak or desperate.

------

If you make concession too early, you may not get agreement **as much as you could** from the other side.

Making concessions can help you avoid a deadlock.

## **Negotiating Techniques**

You can use various techniques to help improve **your chances of having a** successful negotiation.

### **1. Listen actively**

Listen actively to your counterpart to understand their needs and point of view. This shows them that you are interested in their needs, which helps build trust.

------

### **2. Build rapport (t不发言)**

When people have rapport, they understand each other and communicate well. Building rapport increases the chance of reaching an agreement during a negotiation.

Rapport can be built by listening actively, sharing information and finding common interests.

------

We believe that building rapport with our clients is essential to establish **establishing** a long-term relationship.

### **3. Ask open-ended questions.**

Asking open-ended questions allows you to gather more information from the other side. It encourages your counterpart to give longer answers, which helps you understand their position and needs.

------

He could have understood their point of view had he asked additional open-ened questions.

### **4. Set a high anchor**

Setting a high anchor point increases your chances for a good deal.

By setting a high anchor point, your counterpart may make concessions that are closer to what you want. However, if your anchor is too high, you may be seen as unreasonable or unrealistic.

------

If you set a strong modest anchor point, your counterpart will likely make modest counter-offers.

### **5. Emphasize urgency**

Creating a sense of urgency can lead to a quick agreement. If negotiations are moving slowly, you could set a deadline or stop the talks.

But if you push too aggressively, the other side may become uncomfortable and walk away.

------

Creating a sense of urgency can **help you reach a** **quick** **agreement.**

## **Negotiating Styles**

Because people have different negotiating styles, it can be hard to predict how the other party will act in a negotiation.

Knowing different negotiation styles will prepare you to negotiate successfully.

### **1. Avoiding**

Negotiators who have an avoiding style are often cautions and try to avoid conflict.

They don’t immediately pursue**[pəˈsjuː]** their own interests, and let their counterpart control the negotiation.

------

An avoiding style works well when the negotiation is not important or when more information is needed.

### **2. Accommodating**

Accommodating negotiators focus on building and maintaining relationships with their counterpart.

Rather than pursuing their own interests, they are concerned with how to satisfy the needs of the other party.

------

An accommodating style works well when the relationship with the other side **is more significant than** the negotiation.

If one side is too accommodating they may concede more than they need to.

### **3. Compromising**

Compromising negotiators look for the middle ground. They will often make concessions in order to satisfy both parties’ basic needs.

------

We don’t mind compromising and **settling for less** as long as the relationship remains strong.

> 这里我做错2x2次，原因应该是对settling for less这个短语完全懵逼的不熟悉。

### **4. Collaborative [kəˈlæbəreɪtɪv]**

Collaborative negotiators try to understand and cooperate with their counterparts. They focus on solutions that satisfy the needs of both parties as much as possible.

------

A collaborative style can be mutually beneficial because negotiators look for a win-win situation.

### **5. Competitive**

Competitive negotiators are aggressive. They focus on their own needs rather than maintaining a relationship with the other party.

Negotiating in a competitive way can lead to a fast agreement, but it can also lead to a fast deadlock.

------
