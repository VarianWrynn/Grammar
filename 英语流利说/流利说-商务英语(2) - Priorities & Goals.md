## **How to Set Priorities**

When everything you have to do seems important, figuring out where to begin can be difficult. Here are some suggestions to help you evaluate and prioritize your work.

### **1. List your tasks.**

Before you prioritize your work, make a list of your tasks for the day or week. This let you see what you need to do and determine your priorities. And it help you **keep track of** your work.

When you need to work on several important tasks, using a to-do list can **make** you **feel less overwhelmed**. If you do not list what you need to do, you may forget an important task or fail to **prioritize effectively**.

> After you **have listed** the work you need to do, you can determine what **whether** it is a high priority.

### **2. Determine their urgency.**

Urgent tasks that task should be done soon or even immediately.

If something is due by the end of the day, it is likely to be urgent. But if you have a week to finish it, it will be lower priority.

> If a priority is urgent, it should **be handled** as soon as possible.
>
> **The** **closer** **the deadline** **gets****, the more** **urgent** **a project** **becomes**.

### **3. Determine their importance**

Important tasks are valuable activities that will greatly influence your future. You should schedule time for important tasks every day, especially when you feel most productive.

Important tasks usually take a longer time to complete than urgent tasks. Failing to complete important tasks could prevent you from reaching your long-term goals.

> Even if a long report isn’t urgent, it may still be an important priority because it could greatly influence your future.

### **4. Estimate time needed**

Estimate how long it will take to complete each task. **Splitting up** a large assignment into smaller tasks can make it easier to estimate.

If you estimate that something will take a longer time to complete, you should start it soon. Otherwise, you may not have enough time.

> He **had estimated** that this project would take more than a month to finish, so he **started** two months before the deadline.

## **Mismanaging Priorities**

### **1. To underestimate**

To underestimate something means to think it is smaller or less important than it actually is. If you underestimate a task, you think it is easier than it actually is.

When people underestimate the difficulty of a project, they may schedule less time for it.

------

She had overestimated the amount of the time needed for this project, so she scheduled more time than necessary for it.

### **2. To overestimate**

To overestimate something means to think it is bigger or more important than it actually is.

If you overestimate the importance of a task, you assume the task is more important that it actually is.

------

### **3. To ignore**

If you ignore something, you pretend that it doesn’t exist.

To focus on your work, you should ignore distractions, such as social media and text messages.

### **4. To delay**

> Our manager believed these goals were achievable, but we failed to reach any of them.

If something is quantitative, it can be measured by **objectives standards** or **metrics**. A **quantitative** goal may be measured by **statistics**, **data**, or **percentages**.

------
