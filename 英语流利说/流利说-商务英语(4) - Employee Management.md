>
> His boss trusts him **with confidential information**, but he often gossips about it **with** the rest of the team.

### **3. Negative employees**

## **How to Handle Them**

Difficult employees are hard to manage, but they should not be ignored. Here are some **guidelines** that can help you handle them.

### **Observe the behavior**

Before actually approaching the difficult employee, you need to observe their behavior. Consider how their behavior has changed, or how it has been a problem.

Collect **facts about** the difficult employee’s behavior instead of speculating or believing officer rumors.

### **Listen to the employee**

You can have a **one-on-one conversation** with the employee to listen to what they have to say. It gives them a chance to explain and may help you identify the cause of their behavior.

> It gives you a strong sense of the roots of their behavior.

For example, they may have personal problems that make them negative. Or maybe they feel undervalued or are event unaware of how they’re acting.

### **Discussion solutions**

**Once**[1](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s186/client/snv/ce#fn:1) you know what is causing their negative behavior, you can **come up with solutions for it**.

For example, if a employee feels undervalued, you could consider giving them more responsibility. **Addressing the core needs of** an employee can improve their behavior.

### **Follow up with the employee**

After the discussion, regularly follow up with the employee to check their performance. Throughout the process, you need to offer advice and be supportive.

With regular feedback and guidance, an employee can gradually improve. But if an employee hasn’t changed, you may need to **involve HR**[2](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s186/client/snv/ce#fn:2) to take further management actions.

### **Sumary**

Before approaching the difficult employee, you need to observe their behavior,

Then, you can have a one-on-one conversation with employee to listen to what they have to say.

## **How to Give Feedback**

### **1. Impersonal**

To be impersonal means to not show or **involve** personal feelings. Impersonal feedback focuses on someone’s behavior rather than their personality. It **addresses** specific actions that an employee can change.

> Addresses (formal) 设法解决；处理；对付
>
> to think about a problem or a situation and decide how you are going to deal with it (Your essay does not address the real issues)

If feedback criticizes someone’s personality, they may feel insulted and won’t accept it.

> If you don’t use **impersonal feedback** when **talking** to a difficult employee, you may make the situation worse.

### **2. Consistent**

To be consistent means to always behave or happen in a similar way. Keeping your feedback consistent requires you to have standards to evaluate employee behavior.

If your feedback to an employee always changes, they won’t know what they’re expected to do.

> A company’s policies should **be consistently applied to** employees, **regardless of** their roles.
>
> If you give **conflicting** feedback to an employee, you are being inconsistent.

Employees can easily get confused if the feedback they receive is inconsistent.

### **3. Actionable**

Actionable feedback offers clear steps to improve an employee’s performance. It suggests specific ways to change their behavior.

**If feedback only focuses on why an employee needs to improve, but not how they can improve, it will be hard to implement**.

> If you want your employees to change, you need to give them actionable feedback and clear goals to work **towards**
>
> The more specific and constructive your feedback **is**, the more actionable **it is for employee.**
>
> Actionable feedback offers clear steps to improve an employee’s performance.

### **4. Empathetic**

To be empathetic means to **be able to understand and share the feelings of someone else**.

Being empathetic to a difficult employee allows you to look at things from their perspective. This can help you gain a better understanding of **why they behaved the way they did**.

> When you **empathize with** a difficult employee, you can see things **from their perspective**.

## **A Bad Employee**

A：**Thanks for coming to see me**, Daniel. I’ve read your email. You said that **you’ve been having trouble with** one of your team members?

A：This is **a certainly a challenge**. But have you considered changing **your approach** when talking to him?

A：Well. I feel like **you’ve made it sound like** he’s the problem, not his work. I think your feedback can be more effective if it’s framed more around his work.

A: Yeah. Instead of saying “You did this wrong,” say, “This document needs more revisions.” **It may seem unimportant**, but some employees are sensitive.

1. If I tell him that he has done something wrong, he **gets** defensive.

2. But judging from what you’ve said, Sam has got some potential, right?

   > making his feedback less personal.

7. I think your feedback can be more effective if it’s **framed** more around his work.

8. Maybe I make my feedback too personal in negative.

9. **Instead of saying: “You did this wrong”, saying “This document needs more revisions.”** It may seem unimportant, but some of employees are sensitive.

10. I see, maybe I should give more positive encouragement.

11. But you need to show him that his contributions that makes the difference, not just his mistakes.

12. Thanks for your advice, **I will make a better effort.**

    > a 不要漏掉了…. **A** better effort.

13. You’ve said he can be passionate, so he clearly cares about some of the work he does.
